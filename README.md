# Form Creator

## The thinking process behind execution

Got inspiration from google forms page. Started with a white question card. Then added the input for the question then designed a custom dropdown button.
Then I focused on making the options in the dropdown match various question types. After designing the main card to move onto create the sidebar to add new question cards.
